## User Interface

Autumn offers both **Internal** and **External** user interfaces to meet the needs of all types of users.

- The **Internal UI** is designed for quick, in-game access. Simply press **Insert** to open it up and start using the features right away.

- The **External UI** is for users who prefer to manage settings and scripts outside of the game.

No matter your style, Autumn has you covered.
